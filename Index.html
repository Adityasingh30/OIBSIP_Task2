            <p>Miyamoto Musashi was a Ronin in Japan from 1584 to 1645. As one of the most famous swordsman in history he held an impressive 60 duelling record.  
             Not only was Musashi an excellent swordsman, he was also a writer and philosopher. He was the founder of the Hyōhō Niten Ichi-ryū or Niten-ryū style of swordsmanship and in his final years authored The Book of Five Rings, a book on strategy, tactics, and philosophy that is still studied today.  </p>
